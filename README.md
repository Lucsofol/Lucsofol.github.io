# About Me 
## A brief telling of who Lucas Sofolo is   

I am a Senior at Iowa State University majoring in Marketing. I am originally from a small town in Illinois called Roscoe.  
A couple of reasons I enjoy marketing is that it can have such an effect on a business's success and because it allows me to 
use my creativity to my advantage in the subject. For example, brand power and positioning have such an influence on consumer 
preferences, loyalty, and perception that it alone can make or break a firm. Everyone knows Mcdonald's golden arches which go to 
show how powerful a brand can become. Personally, a few activities I enjoy in my free time include running, reading, and watching 
horror movies. Welcome to my page!

# Portfolio Examples 
## Lucas Sofolo's creative works

As I continue to work on creative projects and improve my skills, I will publish my finished products here in order to show my 
progress and skill level. Some creative projects I plan to embark on include blogs on various topics, graphic design pleasure works,
and web-based projects to help improve my skill in that area. I'd like to try writing blogs that can combine my interests and allow 
me to use my creativity. Some topics I think I'd enjoy writing about and could also intrigue some internet browsers are sports talk,
movie reviews, and general open-ended writings in case I want to let out thoughts others could relate to. I'd also like to get 
started on some sports and business graphic designs. Some web-based missions I plan to pursue include starting a vikes_nation 
website.

# Vikes_nation Brand Overview
## Examples of Vikes_nation content from over the years 

This is where I will post examples of my vikes_nation content from over the years. I started the Vikes_nation Instagram way back in 
2014 when I was in 8th Grade. I hold the project close to me because it was started with no intentions other than a passion for the 
Minnesota Vikings and writing about the topic. Over the years, my account has grown from 0 to 22,000 followers, gotten likes from 
multiple current Vikings players, and partnered with various respected brands. Content I post on the account includes edits, 
highlights, news, and lengthy writings going in-depth about everything Minnesota Vikings. Thank you for the follow and support!
