# About Me 
## A brief telling of who Lucas Sofolo is   

I am a Senior at Iowa State University majoring in Marketing. I am originally from a small town in Illinois called Roscoe.  
A couple of reasons I enjoy marketing is that it can have such an effect on a business's success and because it allows me to 
use my creativity to my advantage in the subject. For example, brand power and positioning have such an influence on consumer 
preferences, loyalty, and perception that it alone can make or break a firm. Everyone knows Mcdonald's golden arches which go to 
show how powerful a brand can become. Personally, a few activities I enjoy in my free time include running, reading, and watching 
horror movies. Welcome to my page!
